TODO

- web server that implements the pingdom_custom_http interface for an arbitrary set of URLs
 
- command that will create a "response time check" for an existing Pingdom uptime check -- this will duplicate the check but instead of pointing to the check URL, will point to a specified production server URL running the above custom service

- some examples

- deployment script for easy deployment to a Linux machine
